## Key Demo Capabilities

### 1. Unified Patient Analytics
- **Patient Demographics**: 15 sample patients across Los Angeles area
- **Clinical Encounters**: 20+ encounters with realistic clinical notes and diagnoses
- **Appointment Management**: Scheduled appointments with various providers
- **Prescription Tracking**: 23 prescriptions across 14 pharmacy locations

### 2. Natural Language Queries
The demo supports these key questions that showcase business value:

**Operational Overview:**
- "Show me our patient encounters per day for the last month"

**At-Risk Patient Identification:**
- "Show me patients that haven't picked up their prescription for the last two months and don't have an upcoming appointment"

**Clinical Intelligence:**
- "Summarize the clinical notes for these patients over their last few appointments"

**Prescription Analytics:**
- "What is our overall prescription adherence rate and which medications have the lowest pickup rates?"

### 3. Advanced Analytics Views
- **Patient Unified View**: Complete patient profile combining EHR and pharmacy data
- **Daily Encounter Metrics**: Operational dashboards for capacity planning
- **Prescription Adherence Analysis**: Medication compliance tracking
- **At-Risk Patients View**: Proactive patient identification for outreach
- **Provider Performance Metrics**: Clinical productivity and quality measures

## Technical Architecture

### Data Integration
- **AthenaHealth EHR**: Patient demographics, encounters, appointments, clinical notes
- **McKesson Pharmacy**: Prescriptions, pickup status, pharmacy locations, medication details
- **Unified Analytics Layer**: Combined views enabling cross-system analysis

### Snowflake Intelligence Components
- **Semantic Model**: YAML-based model defining relationships, dimensions, and metrics
- **AI Agent**: Configured with healthcare-specific instructions and capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts business questions to SQL queries
- **Security Framework**: Role-based access control and data masking policies

### Sample Data Highlights
- **Realistic Healthcare Scenarios**: Patients with chronic conditions, medication adherence issues
- **Clinical Complexity**: Encounters with follow-up needs, prescription non-adherence
- **Operational Insights**: Provider utilization, pharmacy performance, patient flow patterns
- **At-Risk Identification**: 6+ patients with unpicked prescriptions and no upcoming appointments

## Business Value Demonstration

### Quantified Benefits
- **$4.5M Annual Savings**: Through improved efficiency and outcomes
- **2,900% ROI**: Over 3 years with 4-month payback period
- **80% Time Reduction**: In routine analytics and reporting tasks
- **10% Improvement**: In medication adherence rates

### Key Use Cases
1. **Proactive Care Management**: Early identification of at-risk patients
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Real-time insights for staffing and capacity planning
3. **Clinical Decision Support**: AI-powered summarization of patient histories
4. **Quality Improvement**: Medication adherence and outcome tracking

## Demo Execution

### Pre-Demo Setup (30 minutes)
1. Verify Snowflake environment and data loading
2. Test agent responses to sample queries
3. Prepare demo materials and backup plans
4. Validate all analytics views are functioning

2. **Operational Overview** (3 min): Daily encounter patterns and trends
3. **At-Risk Identification** (5 min): Proactive patient care management
4. **Clinical Intelligence** (4 min): AI-powered clinical note summarization
5. **Prescription Analytics** (3 min): Medication adherence insights
6. **Closing** (2 min): Business value summary and next steps

### Success Metrics
- Clear demonstration of unified healthcare data analytics
- Natural language query capabilities showcased
- Business value and ROI clearly communicated
- Stakeholder engagement and follow-up interest generated

## Implementation Pathway

### Phase 1: Demo Environment (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up Snowflake environment with sample data
- Configure semantic models and AI agents
- Validate demo scenarios and user training

### Phase 2: Pilot Program (Weeks 3-6)
- Connect to subset of real AthenaHealth and McKesson data
- Deploy to limited user group (10-15 clinical staff)
- Gather feedback and optimize configurations

### Phase 3: Production Rollout (Months 2-6)
- Full data integration with real-time updates
- Enterprise security and compliance implementation
- Organization-wide deployment and training

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
