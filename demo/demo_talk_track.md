## Demo Flow

### Question 1: Operational Overview (3 minutes)

**Query:** "Show me our patient encounters per day for the last month"

**Expected Insights:**
- Daily encounter volumes and trends
- Peak activity days and patterns
- Provider utilization metrics
- Average visit duration

**Talk Track:**
"This gives us a clear picture of our daily operations. We can see that [specific date] was our busiest day with [X] encounters, and our average visit duration is [X] minutes. This helps with staffing decisions and resource allocation."

**Business Value:**
- Optimize staffing schedules
- Identify capacity constraints
- Plan for peak periods

### Question 2: At-Risk Patient Identification (5 minutes)

**Query:** "Show me patients that haven't picked up their prescription for the last two months and don't have an upcoming appointment"

**Expected Insights:**
- List of at-risk patients
- Prescription details and dates
- Contact information for outreach
- Clinical context from recent visits

**Talk Track:**
"This is where Snowflake Intelligence really shines. We've identified [X] patients who may be falling through the cracks. These patients have unpicked prescriptions and no upcoming appointments - they need immediate attention."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Patient names and contact information
- Specific medications not picked up
- Days since prescription was written
- Last encounter date and provider

**Business Value:**
- Prevent medication non-adherence
- Reduce hospital readmissions

- Provider recommendations and follow-up plans
- Care continuity assessment

**Talk Track:**
"Now let's understand the clinical context. The AI agent can summarize complex clinical notes to help us prioritize our outreach. For example, [Patient Name] has [condition] and their last visit indicated [specific concern]. This patient should be our top priority for follow-up."

**Business Value:**
- Prioritize patient outreach efforts
- Understand clinical urgency
- Coordinate care across providers
- Improve care quality metrics

### Question 4: Prescription Adherence Analysis (3 minutes)

**Additional Query:** "What is our overall prescription adherence rate and which medications have the lowest pickup rates?"

**Expected Insights:**
